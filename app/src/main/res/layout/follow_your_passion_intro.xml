\n\n\t\t‘Follow your passion and success will follow you’ is a cliché which almost everyone must have heard. But it is true indeed.
\n\n\t\tIn this competitive world, 9 on 10 people tend to play it safe by securing a job for their lives, whereas that one person stands out; who dreams of working upon his own idea, to make it big one day, waiting for the ‘Eureka!’ moment. Are you that one big-shot among the crowd of ten who wants to inspire and provide jobs to the other nine through a start-up, who has that passion with you but running out of ideas and who is waiting for an inspiration to lead you?
\n\n\t\tThis workshop is just the right one for you, aimed to cultivate the ideas in you by driving you to think diversely to establish a dream start-up around the corner where your love lies.
\n\n\t\tWhat’s better than a start up based on your passion? Speakers from various spheres of work will guide you in your pursuit of a better working atmosphere and to become a successful entrepreneur.
\n\n\t\tAnd who knows, you might even be the Next Start-Up Guru!\n\n"
